# React Tutorials

Hello and welcome. In this library I included a list of projects I created in the tutorials and courses to help you **Master React** as well as ReactJS related libraries. I encourage you to create the projects yourself and just use this as a reference.
Many think that learning is the accumulation of knowledge, however it‚Äôs probably the opposite.  Learning is changing our hobbits.  As Leo Buscaglia nicely put it:

> ‚ÄúChange is the end result of all true learning.‚Äù 

If you want to master Angular, I invite you to checkout [angular-tutorials](https://github.com/EliEladElrom/angular-tutorials).

If you can use help with your React project or have a burning question or an issue in your project that needs help with, I invite you to hire me as your [Coach](https://elielrom.com). My strategy is 100% results-oriented. If you want to sample how I work 1-on-1, let‚Äôs schedule a one-time deep dive [Consultation](https://elielrom.com/CoachingHourly).

## Installation

To download a single folder instead of the entire library from Github, there are many approached you can take, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo).  The easiest way is to use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) site and than paste the directory URL, for instance to download the: [start-project](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FEliEladElrom%2Freact-tutorials%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fstarter-project)

For most of the projects listed here, you can just use my [cra-template-must-have-libraries](https://github.com/EliEladElrom/cra-template-must-have-libraries) project using my starter project as a CRA template;
```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template must-have-libraries
```

Or yarn;

```bash
yarn create react-app your-project-name --template must-have-libraries
```

## Start The Project

To start any CRA based project from the list of projects, download the project, than install the dependencies and lastly, start the local server;

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
