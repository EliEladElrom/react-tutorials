# react-tutorials

Hello and welcome. For your convenience, in this library I included a list of the projects I created in the tutorials and courses to help you 'Master React' as well as ReactJS related libraries. I encourage you to create the projects yourself and just use this as a reference.
Many think that learning is the accumulation of knowledge, however it’s probably the opposite.  Learning is changing our hobbits.  As Leo Buscaglia nicely put it:

> “Change is the end result of all true learning.” 

If you mastering Angular, I invite you to checkout my angular-tutorials: https://github.com/EliEladElrom/angular-tutorials.

If you struggle or need help with your React / React related libraries project or have a burning question or an issue in your project that needs help with, I invite you to hire me as you coach (https://elielrom.com). My strategy is 100% results-oriented. If you want to sample how I work 1-on-1, let’s schedule a one-time deep dive [consultation](https://elielrom.com/CoachingHourly). 

I also put a quick [survey](https://forms.gle/5Va5s9x6NhcWVdn28) to help understand your needs. I will be giving away a free report about the top React libraries you must learn in 2021 that can bust your productivity and improve your skills.

> Note: to download a single folder instead of the entire project from Github, there are many approached you can take, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo).  The easiest way is to use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) site and than paste the directory URL, for instance to download the: [start-project](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FEliEladElrom%2Freact-tutorials%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fstarter-project)
